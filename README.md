# üß† Crypto Price Prediction & Network Analysis

This project applies technical analysis, machine learning, and network science to model and forecast Bitcoin price behavior using signals from its correlated crypto ecosystem and macroeconomic context.

---

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- ‚úÖ BTC price prediction **Linear Regression** and **LSTM**
- üìä Technical indicators computed using the `ta` library (MACD, RSI, MFI, EMA, etc.)
- üåê Integration with **Snowflake** for crypto data staging, historical persistence, and time series upserts
- üßπ Cluster discovery using:
  - K-Means (based on return patterns)
  - Agglomerative (correlation distance)
  - **Louvain** (graph community detection on correlation networks)
- üåê Network graph visualization of crypto relationships and influence
- üßÆ Use of **macroeconomic indicators**, including:
  - Gold (GC=F), Silver (SI=F), S&P 500 (^GSPC), Nasdaq (^NDX), VIX
  - On-chain metrics: hash rate, miner revenue, active addresses, days destroyed
- üî¨ Feature selection using **p-values** from regression analysis
- üìà Model evaluation via:
  - R¬≤ Score
  - RMSE
  - Actual vs Predicted line charts
  - Residual analysis

## üîß Features

- Fetches and stores data in **Snowflake**
- Uses cluster-based filtering for predictive features
- Combines traditional market, blockchain metrics, and crypto-specific TA

### üè© Macroeconomic + On-chain Data

- Traditional assets:
  - S&P 500 (^GSPC), Nasdaq (^NDX), Gold (GC=F), Silver (SI=F), VIX
- On-chain metrics from [blockchain.com API]:
  - Hash rate, miner revenue, Bitcoin days destroyed, difficulty, active addresses
- BTC-to-local-currency tickers:
  - BTC-INR, BTC-GBP, BTC-RUB, etc.

## üß† Model Insights

### ‚úÖ Linear Regression (with reduced features)

- R¬≤ Score: **0.9756**
- RMSE: **\$2412**

### ‚úÖ LSTM (price delta prediction)

- R¬≤ Score: **0.9826**
- RMSE: **\$2097**

### üí° Observations

- Predicting **price delta** (instead of raw price) significantly improved LSTM's stability and interpretability.
- **LSTM now outperforms linear regression**, especially in volatile windows.
- Models trained with **Louvain-filtered features** show higher signal strength by reducing noise from low-correlation assets.
- All performance metrics are computed with **inverse-transformed prices** to preserve dollar-accuracy.

## üìå Notes

- Ensure your Snowflake user has correct **roles and permissions**
- [FRED API] and `yfinance` are used for macro and market data
- VPNs or regional restrictions may block some endpoints

## üîê Snowflake Key Pair Authentication Setup

This project uses **key pair authentication** to securely connect to Snowflake.

### üîß Step 1: Generate Public/Private Key Pair

#### For Linux/macOS (OpenSSL):

```bash
openssl genrsa -out rsa_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in rsa_key.pem -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
```

#### For Windows (using PowerShell + OpenSSL):

1. Install [OpenSSL for Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
2. Run:

```powershell
openssl genrsa -out rsa_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in rsa_key.pem -pubout -out rsa_key.pub
```

> üìù Or use PuTTYgen (convert to PEM format)

---

### üîê Step 2: Upload Public Key to Snowflake

```sql
ALTER USER your_user_name SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='your_public_key_contents';
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `END` lines

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Add `.env` Variables

```ini
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/rsa_key.pem
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account_id
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_user_name
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=CryptoDB
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=PUBLIC
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=ACCOUNTADMIN
```

---

### ‚úÖ You're Ready!

Your notebook will now securely connect to Snowflake using your key.
